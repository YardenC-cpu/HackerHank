This coding question is taken from a take home assingment that I did.

Description:
We are given a list of "objects" (a list of numbers) and a radius. 
Our purpose is to place the lamp and return its index such that it is cover the maximum number of objects. In case that there is more than 1 solution
then we want to return the minimal coordinate. 

The radius range: o = our object. [o-radius, 0+radius]

Example: given objects = [-5,-3,4,9] and radius=5 the output should be -1. 
Since we can cover 3 objects by placing the lamp on -1,0,4,5,6,7, we are choosing the smaller one which is -1.
